# Rancher Community Office Hours

Rancher Community Office Hours is a live stream hosted by Adrian Goins and joined by Rancher Labs employees and select members of the community, in which we answer live questions about Rancher Products and Projects and general questions about Kubernetes. 

It's broadcast on [YouTube][2], with chat taking place in the `#office-hours` channel on the [Rancher Users Slack](https://slack.rancher.io).

## Mission and Intent

Office Hours is for the community to ask questions and engage in discussion with Rancher staff and other members of the community. This time is when we'll answer questions and  talk about how people are using Kubernetes and Rancher solutions to power their environments, and it's a great opportunity to share your experiences and learn from others.

## Who Should Join?

Anyone interested in Kubernetes is welcome to join. The content will include information about using Rancher to deploy and manage Kubernetes, but since Rancher is a Kubernetes management solution, the conversation will also cover broad topics in the Kubernetes and cloud native ecosystem.

## When and Where

We host the office hours monthly, at two different times:

- EMEA Session - Third Wednesday of the month at 0900 ET
- US Session - Second Wednesday of the month at 1300 PT

Join us on [YouTube][2] to watch the stream, and during the streams, join `#office-hours` on the [Rancher Users Slack][1] to participate in the discussion.

## How It Works

We'll answer prepared questions or live questions during the show. Prepared questions take priority because we can update them with the answers after the show. This helps build a community knowledge base for Rancher and Kubernetes that benefits everyone.

If the question is well-formed but needs more research before we can answer it, we'll make a note to answer it on a future show.

### Prepared Questions

Whenever possible, please submit questions in advance so that panelists can prepare for the session ahead of time. You can do this in **one** of the following locations:

- [Rancher Forums](https://forums.rancher.com)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com), tagged with any of the following:
  - rancher
  - k3s
  - longhorn
  - rke

### Live Questions

You can submit questions live in the `#office-hours` channel of the [Rancher Users Slack][1], and we'll answer them after answering the prepared questions. This is a great opportunity to collect the different opinions from our panel of subject matter experts and learn from their experience working with software in the Kubernetes ecosystem.

***See below for how to become one of our subject matter experts!***

### Phrasing a Question Well

With your help, we can provide information that benefits the entire community by "teaching people how to fish," as it were.

If we show how to approach problems, collect information, and perform troubleshooting, we raise the level of skill of everyone in the community. When we do this, everyone benefits.

Questions that are a good fit for office hours are specific enough that they raise an issue, yet broad enough that the answer applies to more than just a single environment. Use "How" and "Where" instead of "Why" in questions.

#### **Instead Of Asking This:** 

1. Why doesn't Rancher pick up changes in the Catalog?
   - The answer to this question depends on environmental configuration we don't have access to.
2. How do I expose Services publicly?
   - This is a general Kubernetes question and not Rancher-specific.
3. How do you set up Ingress for a Kubernetes cluster in Rancher?
   - This is also a general Kubernetes question, because Rancher is just configuring Kubernetes.
4. Where do I find `/etc/kubernetes/kube-apiserver.yaml`  on a Rancher system?
   - This question doesn't provide information about the actual problem that needs to be solved.

#### **Ask This:**

1. Where can I see log output from Rancher Catalog refreshes to troubleshoot why version changes to my catalog app aren't being picked up?
   - This question allows us to teach the community how to troubleshoot the App Catalog.
2. How can I use xip.io hostnames on hosts that don't know their public IP addresses?
   - This question allows us to solve a scenario that many people might encounter.
3. When I create an Ingress in Rancher, I'm either directed to the Rancher UI or to a 404 page.
   - This shows that the problem is specific to an action within Rancher, and we can present an answer that incorporates troubleshooting for both Kubernetes and Rancher.
4. How do I enable Kubernetes feature gates with RKE?
   - This question presents the actual problem, which we can quickly solve.
