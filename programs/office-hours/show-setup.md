### Introduction

Hello everyone! Welcome to today's session of the Rancher Office Hours. I'm your host, {full name}, and I'm the {full title} at {company}.

We're here to answer your questions about Rancher's solutions, so come join us in the office-hours channel on the Rancher Users Slack! If you don't already have an invitation, you can get one for free at slack.rancher.io.

Before we dive in, let's do a round of introductions: (Give each panelist about a minute to introduce themselves.)

And no introduction to a public event would be complete without some ground rules:

(share slides with the following bullets)

- This is a safe space that exists to help members of the community grow from the experience of others.
- Everyone is welcome here, and we expect everyone to treat each other with respect and dignity.
- There are no stupid questions, but we do ask that you limit your questions to topics around how to use Rancher, Kubernetes, and other CNCF tooling.
- We will do our best to answer every question, but we don't have access to your specific environment. That means that we may not be able to do specific debugging of local issues, but we will do our best to get you to the next step in your troubleshooting.
- Panelists, we encourage you to jump in and answer any question or add more information from your own experience that will help the person asking.
- Audience - you can help us out in the chat by pasting URLs for official documentation, blogs, tweets, or anything else that might be relevant to the conversation.
- We take both live questions and prepared questions, so between sessions, please post your questions on the Rancher Forums or on Stack Overflow, tagged with "rancher," "k3s," "rke" or "longhorn."
- You can also help us out by following Rancher_Labs on Twitter and re-tweeting the announcements for upcoming sessions. The more people we have here, the better it'll be for everyone.
- If you'd like to be one of our panelists in a future session, please reach out to @adrian on the Rancher Users Slack and let him know.
- If you're new to Kubernetes or Rancher, we have a weekly intro to Kubernetes and Rancher training that will get you up and running. For comprehensive training on Rancher and using it to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters, check out the Rancher Academy.

TBD

### Outro

That's all for today, folks. Thank you for coming, and thanks to {name, name, and name} for helping out on our panel today.

The office-hours channel is always open, so feel free to hang out and continue the conversation. We do this every month, and I look forward to seeing you at the next one!

Until then, stay safe, and keep on Ranching.
